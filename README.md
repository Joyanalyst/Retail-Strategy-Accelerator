# RETAIL PROFITABILITY AND OPERATIONAL HEALTH ANALYSIS
### Toolset: Excel Power Pivot, DAX, Financial Modeling, Data Modeling
### Timeline: 2023–2025 (Synthetic Dataset from [Excel.com](https://excelx.com/practice-data/sales-retail/))

## Project Overview
### This project provides a comprehensive financial and operational analysis of a multi-product retail business spanning three years. Built using Excel Power Pivot and DAX, this solution provides insights into sales seasonality, product return risks, promotional ROI, and regional fulfillment efficiency to empower retail leaders to optimize fulfillment, improve profitability, and enhance promotional effectiveness.
### The project aims at:
### - Identifying fulfillment bottlenecks and regional inefficiencies
### - Evaluating product-level profitability and return risks
### - Assessing the ROI of promotional campaigns
### - Uncovering seasonal sales patterns and growth volatility
### - Segmenting customer behavior to inform upselling strategies

## Key Techniques
### •	Advanced Time Intelligence: YoY and QoQ growth metrics using DAX
### •	Return Rate Calculation: SUMX logic to accurately quantify returned items
### •	Financial Modeling: Imputed unit cost based on a 35% markup to derive profit margins
### •	Data Modeling: Creation of dimension tables for time and order granularity
### •	Customer Segmentation: ATV analysis across retail vs wholesale customers

## Executive Summary
### The analysis shows a strong sales seasonality in the first quarter (Q1) of each year. YoY/QoQ growth is highly volatile, indicating inconsistent momentum outside of the peak periods.
## Insight Deep Dive
### 1.	Sales and Seasonality
###     Sales are highly concentrated in Q1 with $502,717.80 in 2023, $450,312.98 in 2024, and 4921,476.50 in 2025 respectively, indicating a peak period over Q2, Q3 and Q4 with a slightly declined sales. QoQ sales growth is volatile, as the growth fluctuates between each quarter, as recorded in Q3 with a positive growth of 12.63% in 2023 and a negative growth of -13.23% in 2024. This serves as a necessary             indicator to assess momentum outside of peak periods 
### 2.	Return rate red flags
### The analysis recorded the top 3 products with the highest return rates. The Laptop had the highest return rate of 47.43% in the south region, while the monitor and chair had return rates of 44.49% and 35.71% in the west region, respectively. These figures exceed the industry benchmark and directly indicate either a systematic product quality issue or a significant discrepancy between the product description/expectation setting.
